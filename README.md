npm install -g @vue/cli @aws-amplify/cli

"The Amplify CLI allows us to deploy our web application with two simple commands:
amplify add hosting 
amplify publish
However, I have not chosen this method, wanting to test the potential of CI/CD that Amplify makes available. To do this you need to use the Amplify Console.
We first place the solution source code on a Git repository. Using the Amplify console we must connect the branch of our repository to implement the pipeline."
